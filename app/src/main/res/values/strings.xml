        AQI, or Air Quality index, is a system for reporting the severity of air quality levels in relatable terms to the public.
        The index ranges from 0 to 300+,where high index values indicate higher levels of air pollution and higher potential for adverse health effects.
        Any value larger than 300, for example, is considered to be hazardous, while an AQI value of 0-50, on the other hand, represents good air quality.
